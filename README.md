## ðŸ¤– How the Summarizer Works
- The first time you use the summarizer, the app will automatically download the `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model from Hugging Face (~1.5GB). This requires an internet connection.
- The model is cached for future use (no repeated downloads).
- No model files are stored in this repo.
