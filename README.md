## üìä Code Quality Report
This project is analyzed by SonarCloud for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells. Go to https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=tassnimelleuch_DevOps-Internship

---

## ü§ñ How the Summarizer Works
- The first time you use the summarizer, the app will automatically download the facebook/bart-large-cnn model from Hugging Face (~1.5GB). This requires an internet connection.
- The model is cached for future use (no repeated downloads).
- No model files are stored in this repo.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
- If you get a port error, make sure nothing else is using port 5000.
- If you change the code, rebuild the Docker image before running again.
- For any issues, check the logs in your terminal for error messages.
