## How the Summarizer Works
- The first time you use the summarizer, the app will automatically download the `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model from Hugging Face (~1.5GB). This requires an internet connection.
- The model is cached for future use (no repeated downloads).
- You can summarize any text by clicking the **Summarize** button on the main page, entering your text, and clicking **Summarize**.

---

## Notes
- **No model files are stored in this repo.** The summarizer uses Hugging Face's model hub for easy, legal, and scalable model access.
- If you want to pre-download the model (optional):
  ```bash
  python -c "from transformers import pipeline; pipeline('summarization', model='facebook/bart-large-cnn')"
  ```
- Add these lines to your `.gitignore` to avoid committing model files:
  ```
  # Hugging Face cache
  .cache/huggingface/
  models/
  ```
